## Important Note:

Please note, this information is provided as is, and we do not provide application engineering or comprehensive technical
support.  Also, we do not guarantee our station will meet the needs of your specific application.  If you have questions, they
should be submitted through email and they will be answered when resources are available.  Also, although we would not do
so without good reason, we reserve the right to modify our weather station design without warning at any time.


## I. Introduction
Thank you for choosing Davis Instruments for your weather application.   This document explains the
serial data protocol between the Vantage Pro, Vantage Pro2, Vantage Vue consoles (or Envoys) and a
PC. This requires a WeatherLink with Standard Data Logger

Note, the serial communication between Vantage Pro and Vantage Pro2 are very similar except in a few
places noted in this document.  Important differences are described in section III.

Serial communication parameters are:
8 data bits, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity.
Default baud rate is 19200. User selectable between 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, and 19200 baud.

The console with a WeatherLink data logger has 3 types of memory:
 132 KB archive memory, which stores up to 2560 archive records
 4 KB EEPROM memory, which is used for calibration numbers, station
latitude/longitude/elevation/timezone values, transmitter configuration, and Console graph points
 4 KB of processor memory, which is used to store the current sensor data, today’s high/low
values, and other real-time values. This memory is not directly available to the PC!
Commands such as LOOP, provide access to the most useful and important of these data values.

Commands are primarily ASCII strings. Letters should be in ALL CAPS. Please note that in some
strings numeric values are in decimal, while in others are in hexadecimal.

Multi-byte binary values are generally stored and sent least significant byte first. Negative numbers use
2's complement notation. CRC values are sent and received most significant byte first.

II. Additonal Commands Not in Monitor II
- An expanded LOOP packet is the only way to receive the current weather data. There is no
command to get a single parameter (such as outside temperature).
- Similarly there is a HILOWS command to receive all of the current daily, monthly, and yearly
high/low values with corresponding dates and times.
- A special DMPAFT command allows you to specify the last record you have previously
downloaded so that only the records after that one are downloaded. There is no need to clear the
archive memory to keep download times short. The downloaded records are pre-sorted, so you
do not have to determine where the first record is.
- You can not reset individual high or low values. Instead there are commands to clear all the high
values or all the low values.
- You must make sure that the console is awake before sending commands to it.

III. Differences between Vantage Pro and Vantage Pro 2
The Vantage Pro2 serial support is almost the same as the Vantage Pro, but there are some important
differences listed below.
- Serial commands for Vantage Pro2 must be terminated by a single line feed or a single carriage
return character, but not both.  Older code that terminates commands with both a line feed and a
carriage return will not work or will work intermittently.  Beware that some communciation
programs translate a line feed to both a line feed and a carriage return.
- The locations of the graph data has changed in Vantage Pro2.
- The transmission packet interval of the Vantage Pro2 ISS is 1/16 of a second longer for every
station ID number.  For example, ID 1 transmits at an interval of every 2.5625 seconds rather
than 2.5 seconds.
- “GAIN” command is supported in Vantage Pro but not in Vantage Pro2.
- “STRMON” command returns data packet in different format for Vantage Pro2.
- Vantage Pro2 does not support different transmitting period.  It only supports the normal ISS
transmit period.
- Vantage Pro2 does not support SensorLink station type.
- Vantage Pro2 with firmware 1.90 or later supports “LPS” command, but Vantage Pro does not.

IV. Differences between Vantage Pro 2 and Vantage Vue
The Vantage Vue command protocol is substantially the same as the Vantage Pro 2. The primary
differences are: the "console type" value returned by the "WRD"... command is 17 instead of 16 for the
Vantage Pro, the list of supported sensors and transmitter types is smaller, and the EEPROM graph
memory layout is different.

V. Waking up the Console
In order to conserve battery power, the console spends as much time “asleep” as possible, waking up
only when required. Receiving a character on the serial port will cause the console to wake up, but it
might not wake up fast enough to read the first character correctly. Because of this, you should always
perform a wakeup procedure before sending commands to the console:

Console Wakeup procedure:
- Send a Line Feed character, ‘\n’ (decimal 10, hex 0x0A).
- Listen for a returned response of Line Feed and Carriage Return characters, (‘\n\r’).
- If there is no response within a reasonable interval (say 1.2 seconds), then try steps 1 and 2 again
up to a total of 3 attempts.
- If the console has not woken up after 3 attempts, then signal a connection error

After the console has woken up, it will remain awake for 2 minutes. Every time the Vantage receives
another character, the 2 minute timer will be reset.

Please note that this is NOT TRUE for the LOOP command. In the LOOP mode, we expect that the
LOOP packets will be sent over time, so the Vantage will go to sleep immediately between each packet.


Page 7 of 59
VI. Blackout Periods
The console will not process commands when it is in any of the Setup screens (except the first:
"Receiving From..."). It will also not process commands when the console is in a number entry mode
(e.g. setting an alarm value).

Similarly, when a Download is in progress, the console will not respond to key presses and will not
receive data packets from remote sensors.

VII. Command Formats
The command strings given in the following sections must be followed by a Line Feed characters (‘\n’
or 0x0A or decimal 10) before the console will execute the command.

There are 3 different types of numbers that can be used as command parameters: decimal, hexadecimal
and binary.  Command parameters are shown with “<parameter name-decimal>”, “<parameter name-
hex>”, or “<parameter name-binary>” to indicate which format should be used in each case.

Please note that using the correct number of spaces is very important. For example the command "LOOP
<number of LOOP packets to send-decimal>" should be realized with the string "LOOP
4" (i.e. a single space between the "P" and the "4").

There are several different types of command responses. These responses come before any other
returned data values.

- ACK response: when this command is recognized, the console responds with an ASCII ACK
(0x06) character. If the command parameters are invalid, a Not Acknowledge response of (0x21)
is used. If a block of data is sent with a CRC code, the response CANCEL (0x18) means that the
data did not pass the CRC check.
Note: The DMP and DMPAFT commands can use the character <0x15> for negative
ascknoledgements. See the detailed documentation of these commands in Section XI Download
Protocol below for more details.
- “OK” response: when  this command is recognized, the console responds with the character
string “\n\rOK\n\r”.
- “DONE” response: Some commands take some time to complete their operation. For example
the command “CLRGRA” will clear all the console graph points. The Vantage will respond with
an “OK” when it receives the command, and “DONE” when it is finished. Do not attempt to
send any commands to the console until the “DONE\n\r” response has been received.

IX. Command Details
All commands must be terminated by a single line feed character (‘\n’) or a single carriage return
character (‘\r’).  These are not shown in the command syntax, but are shown in the examples.   Beware
that some systems may translate a new line character into both a new line and a carriage return which
will cause intermittent operation when using a Vantage Pro2 console.

In the following command examples, lines starting with “>” are set to the console, and lines starting
with “<” are received from the console.

Character symbols
## Symbol          Value          Name
## <CR>
0x0D Carriage return, “\r”
## <LF>
0x0A Line Feed, “\n”
## <ACK>
## 0x06        Acknowledge
## <NAK>
## 0x21        Not        Acknowledge
## <CANCEL>
0x18 Bad CRC code
## <0xdd>
0xdd Character code specified in hex.

- Testing commands
## "TEST"
It sends the string “TEST\n” back. Mostly useful when using HyperTerminal for testing a connection
to the console.

## Example:
## >"TEST"<LF>
## <"TEST"<LF><CR>

"WRD"<0x12><0x4d>
This is the same command sequence used by earlier Davis weather stations to read the Station Type
value. The station will respond with an <ACK> and then a one byte identifier, which can be one of
these values:

## Value      Station      Value       Station
0 Wizard III 5 Energy Enviromontor
1 Wizard II 6 Health Enviromonitor
## 2              Monitor
## 3 Perception 16 Vantage Pro, Vantage Pro 2
4              GroWeather              17              Vantage              Vue

## Example:
>"WRD"<0x12><0x4D><LF>
## <<ACK><16>

Page 11 of 59

## "RXCHECK"
It sends the Console Diagnostics report. The following values are sent on one line as a text string:
total packets received, total packets missed, number of resynchronizations, the largest number of
packets received in a row., and the number of CRC errors detected.

All values are recorded since midnight, or since the diagnostics are cleared manually.

## Example:
## >"RXCHECK"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>”OK”<LF><CR>" 21629 15 0 3204 128"<LF><CR>

It shows we received 21,629 packets, missed 15 packets, there were no resynchronizations, the
maximum number of packets received in a row without an error was 3204, and there were 128 CRC
errors detected.

## "STRMON"
It echos all of the data packets sent by sensor transmitters. The station will respond with an “OK”
message and Davis Talk data packets when received by the console until the STRMOFF command is
given.

For Vantage Pro, each packet contains six bytes and each byte is shown as a two-digit hex string per
line, with a blank line between packets.

For VantagePro 2, each packet contains eight bytes instead of six and it returns the byte number
along with the content for better clarity.

Example (VantagePro):
## >"STRMON"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>
## <"F7"<LF><CR>
## <"07"<LF><CR>
## <"E0"<LF><CR>
## <"82"<LF><CR>
## <"08"<LF><CR>
## <"C4"<LF><CR> . . .

Example (VantagePro2):
## >"STRMON"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>
## <"0 = 81"<LF><CR>
## <"1 = 0"<LF><CR>
## <"2 = 0"<LF><CR>
<"3 = ff"<LF><CR>
<"4 = c5"<LF><CR>

Page 12 of 59
## <"5 = 0"<LF><CR>
<"6 = b7"<LF><CR>
## <"7 = 42"<LF><CR><LF><CR> . . .

## "STRMOFF"

It halts the flow of Davis Talk data packets started by the STRMON command. Note that this
command is the only way to stop receiving Davis Talk data packets.

## Example:
## >"STRMOFF"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

## "VER"
It sends the firmware date code as a text string. Some functions on the console are implemented
differently in different firmware versions. See the separate file "Vantage Console Firmware Release
History.doc" or "Envoy Firmware Release History.doc" to determine which functions are available
with each firmware version.

The date code is sent in the following format:
“Mmm dd yyyy”
Mmm is the three-letter English month abbreviation
dd is the day of the month
yyyy is the year.

## Example:
## >"VER"<LF>
<<LF><CR>”OK”<LF><CR>"Apr 24 2002"<LF><CR>

## "RECEIVERS"
It sends a byte that contains the stations received in the "Receiving From ..." setup screen. The
station responds with “OK” followed by the bit map. For each bit position, a value of 1 indicates that
that transmitter was received. Bit position 0 (least significant bit) corresponds with Tx ID 1 in the
Davis Talk protocol.

## Example:
## >"RECEIVERS"<LF>
<<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR><0x01>
## "NVER"
It sends the firmware version as a text string. Some functions on the console are implemented
differently in different firmware versions. See the separate file "Vantage Console Firmware Release
History.doc" or "Envoy Firmware Release History.doc" to determine which functions are available
with each firmware version.

The version sent in the following format:
x.xx

Page 13 of 59

## Example:
## >"NVER"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>”OK”<LF><CR>"1.73"<LF><CR>

- Current Data commands
"LOOP <number of LOOP packets to send-decimal>"
It sends the specified number of LOOP packets, 1 every 2 seconds. Console sleeps between each
packet sent. The station responds with an <ACK> then with binary data packet every 2 seconds.

To halt the sending of LOOP packets before receiving all of the requested packets, send a <CR> by
itself. Note that this is the same as the Wakeup sequence.

Each data packet is 99 bytes long and contains most of the current data values shown on the vantage
console. In addition, the state of alarms, the battery status of the console and the transmitters, the
weather forecast icon, and the sunrise and sunset times are included. Rev B and Vantage Pro2
firmware also have the 3 hour barometer trend value. A CRC value is calculated and transmitted so
that the PC can validate the transmission accuracy of the data. The data format is described in detail
in section X.1

Example (request 4 LOOP packets):
## >"LOOP 4"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<99 byte LOOP packet> . . .

"LPS <loop packet type bit mask-decimal><number of packets to send-decimal>"
It sends the specified number of the different type LOOP packets, 1 every 2.5 seconds. It supports up
to 8 different types of loop packets, with each bit maps to one type.  So far only two types are
supported, bit 0 for LOOP packet, bit 1 for LOOP2 packet.  If both bits are set to 1s, the LOOP and
the LOOP2 packet will be sent one after another.  If more than one type of loop packet is selected,
the number of packets to send is the total number of all the different type of loop packets.  Console
sleeps between each packet sent. The station responds with an <ACK> then with binary data packet
every 2.5 seconds.

To halt the sending of LOOP packets before receiving all of the requested packets, send a <CR> by
itself. Note that this is the same as the Wakeup sequence.

All the loop packets are 99 bytes long and contain most of the current data values shown on the
Vantage Pro, Vantage Pro2 and Vantage Vue consoles.  See the previous section for LOOP packet
details.

Example (request 2  LOOP and  2 LOOP2 packets):
## >"LPS 3 4"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<99 byte LOOP packet>...

Page 14 of 59
Wait 2.5 seconds
<<99 byte LOOP2 packet>...

Example (request 1 LOOP2 packets):
## >"LPS 2 1"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<99 byte LOOP2 packet>...

## "HILOWS"
It sends all the current high/low data in a single data block. The station responds with an <ACK>
then a 436 byte data block that includes all the daily, monthly, and yearly high and low values on the
Vantage console, and then a 2 byte CRC value. This is so that the PC can validate the transmission
accuracy of the data. The data format is described in detail in section X.2 .

## Example:
## >"HILOWS"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<436 byte hi/low packet><2-Byte CRC>

"PUTRAIN <Yearly Rain in rain clicks-decimal>"
It sets the Yearly rainfall amount on the console.

Example (set the Yearly rain to 24.83 inches):
## >"PUTRAIN 2483"<LF>
## <<ACK>

The console shows yearly rain of 24.83 inches (assuming that the rain collector is configured for a
0.01" collector).

"PUTET <Yearly ET in 100th inch-decimal"
It sets the Yearly ET amount on the console

Example (set the Yearly ET to 24.83 inchex):
## >"PUTET 2483"<LF>
## <<ACK>

The console display shows yearly ET 24.83 inches.

## 3. Download Commands
## "DMP"
It downloads the entire archive memory. See the sections X.6 and X.4 for more details on
downloading data.

## "DMPAFT"

Page 15 of 59
It downloads the records after a specified date and time. See the sections X.6 and X.4 for more
details on downloading data.

- EEPROM Commands
## "GETEE"
It reads the full 4K EEPROM in one data block. There is also a 2 byte CRC.

## Example:
## >"GETEE"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<4096 byte block of EEPROM data>
<<2-Byte CRC>

"EERD <EE address-hex> <number of bytes to read-hex>"
It reads the specified number of bytes starting at the specified address. Results are given as hex
strings, one byte per line. See section XIII for more details on accessing EEPROM data.

Example (Read the station Longitude [-122.1]):
## >"EERD 0D 02"<LF>
## <"OK"<LF><CR>
## <"3B"<LF><CR>
## <"FB"<LF><CR>
-- 0xFB3B = -1221

"EEWR <EE address-hex> <EE data-hex>"
It writes one byte of data to the specified address in the EEPROM. See section XIII for more details
on accessing EEPROM data.

Example (It writes 0x87 to EEPROM address 0x58.):
## >"EEWR 58 87"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

"EEBRD <EE address-hex> < number of bytes to read-hex>"
Reads data in binary format from the EEPROM. The data and CRC is given in binary format
following an ACK response. See section XIII for more details on accessing EEPROM data.

Example (It reads three bytes from the EEPROM at location 0x32.)
## >"EEBRD 32 03"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<0x05><0xFA><0x0E><2-Byte CRC>



Page 16 of 59
"EEBWR <EE address-hex> <number of bytes to write-hex>"
It writes data to the EEPROM. The data and CRC is given in binary format following an ACK
response. See section XIII for more details on accessing EEPROM data.

Example (Set the time alarm to 7:15 am, the TIME_COMP field must also be set):
## >"EEBWR 54 04"<LF>
## <<ACK>
><0xCB><0x02><0x34><0xFD><2-Byte CRC>

## 5. Calibration Commands
## "CALED"
It sends a block of data with the current temperature and humidity values for setting calibration
values. These values are the current CALIBRATED sensor values. The data format is the same that
is used in the
"CALFIX" command.

## Example:
## >"CALED"<LF>
## <<ACK>
<<43 bytes of data block with current data values><2-Byte CRC>

## "CALFIX"
It updates the display when temperature and humidity calibration numbers have been changed. The
values sent should be UN-CALIBRATED sensor values.

## Example:
## >"CALFIX"<LF>
## <<ACK>
><43 bytes of data block with raw sensor values><2-Byte CRC>
## <<ACK>

"BAR=<bar value to display (in Hg * 1000)-decimal> <elevation (ft)-decimal>"
It sets the elevation and barometer offset values when setting the barometer for a new location.

<bar value to display (in Hg * 1000)-decimal>
If you have a current barometer reading from a very reliable nearby reference, you can use this
parameter to force the display to an exact setting. The console uses this value to fine-tune its own
adjusted barometric pressure calculations. Do not use this setting alone to correct your barometer to
sea-level.

Use a value of zero when you do not have an exact barometer value that you want the Vantage
console to display. This also clears out any existing offset value previously set.

This value should either be zero or between 20.000” Hg and 32500” Hg.

< elevation (ft)-decimal>

Page 17 of 59
This is the primary means to correct the barometer measurement. Negative values for elevation can
be used.

This value should be between -2000 ft and 15000 ft.

Example (No local Barometer value, elevation 132 ft):
## >"BAR=0 132"<LF>
## <<ACK>

Example (Barometer value = 29.491 in Hg, elevation 0 ft):
## >"BAR=29491 0"<LF>
## <<ACK>

Example (Barometer value = 29.991 in Hg, elevation -75 ft):
## >"BAR=29991 -75"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## "BARDATA"
It retrieves the current barometer calibration parameters in text. These tell you what the current
elevation setting and barometer offset values are, plus some details on the barometer correction
factor being used.

## Example:
## >"BARDATA"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

## OFFSET

## 6. Clearing Commands
## "CLRLOG"
It clears the archived data.

## Example:
## >"CLRLOG"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## "CLRALM"
It clears all the alarm thresholds. Use "CLRBITS" to clear any active alarms.

This command takes time to perform, so you must wait for the console to send "DONE" before
sending any further commands

## Example:
## >"CLRALM"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>
-- After some time passes --
## <"DONE"<LF><CR>

## "CLRCAL"
Clears all the Temperature and Humidity calibration offsets to zero.

Note that the values displayed on the console do not use the new calibration values until a new data
packet arrives for that sensor. You must use the procedure from section XIV.1 to force the current
display to use the new cal numbers

## Example:
## >"CLRCAL"<LF>
## <"OK"<LF><CR>
-- After some time passes --
## <"DONE"<LF><CR>

## "CLRGRA"
It clears all of the graph points on the Vantage console.

## Example:
## >"CLRGRA"<LF>
## <"OK"<LF><CR>
-- After some time passes --
## <"DONE"<LF><CR>

Page 19 of 59

"CLRVAR <Data variable-decimal>"
It clears a rain or ET data value from the following table:
Rain Variable Name Number     ET Variable Name Number
Daily Rain 13 Day ET 26
Storm Rain 14 Month ET 25
Month Rain 16 Year ET 27
## Year Rain 17

Results are undefined if you use a number not on this list

Example (Clear Month Rain value):
## >"CLRVAR 16"<LF>
## <<ACK>

"CLRHIGHS <0, 1, or 2>"
It clears all of the daily (0), monthly (1), or yearly (2) high values

Example (Clear Monthly High values):
## >"CLRHIGHS 1"<LF>
## <<ACK>

"CLRLOWS <0, 1, or 2>"
It clears all of the daily (0), monthly (1), or yearly (2) low values

Example (Clear Yearly Low values):
## >"CLRLOWS 2"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## "CLRBITS"
It clears the active alarm bits. They will reactivate if the alarm condition is still present.

## Example:
## >"CLRBITS"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## "CLRDATA"
It clears all current data values to dashes.

## Example:
## >"CLRDATA"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## 7. Configuration Commands
"BAUD <New baud rate-decimal>"
It sets the console to a new baud rate. Valid values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, and 19200. If
the new baud rate is accepted, an "OK" will be returned at the new baud rate.
If it is not, a "NO" will be returned and the baud rate will not be changed.

Example (to set 9600 baud):
## >"BAUD 9600"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

## "SETTIME"
It sets the time and date on the console. Data in a binary format is sent after ACK.

The data is 6 bytes plus a 2 bytes of CRC. The each field is one byte. The fields, in order, are:
seconds, minutes, hour (24 hour format), day, month, year – 1900.  See section XII for more
information on calculating CRC values.

Example (to set 3:27:00 pm, June 4, 2003):
## >"SETTIME"<LF>
## <<ACK>
><0><27><15><4><6><103><2 Bytes of CRC>
## <<ACK>

## "GETTIME"
It retrieves the current time and date on the console. Data is sent in a binary format.
The format is the same as the SETTIME command.

Example (Vantage responds with 5:17:42 am, January 28, 1998):
## >"GETTIME"<LF>
## <<ACK>
><42><17><5><28><1><98><2 Bytes of CRC>

"GAIN <Gain State: '0' (off) or '1' (on)>"
This command only works with the VantagePro station and is not currently implemented on the VantagePro 2 or Vue
stations.
It sets the gain of the radio receiver, same as pressing the HI/LOW key on the console diagnostics
screen. "GAIN 1" turns the gain on. "GAIN <Anything else>" turns the gain off:

Example (Turn on the Radio Gain):
## >"GAIN 1"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

Example (Turn off the Radio Gain):
## >"GAIN 0"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

Page 21 of 59

"SETPER <Archive interval in minutes-decimal>"
It sets the console archive interval. This is the interval that archive data records are recorded into the
archive memory. The smaller this value is, the faster the archive memory will fill up.

Valid values are (1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120). Results are undefined if you try to select an archive
period not on the list.

This command automatically clears the archive memory. Use the "
CLRLOG" command to clear the
archive memory. WeatherLink clears the archive memory so that all archived records in the archive
memory use the same archive interval.

Example (set a 10 minute archive interval):
## >"SETPER 10"<LF>
## <<ACK>

## "STOP"
It disables the creation of archive records.

## "START"
It enables the creation of archive records, if they have been halted with the STOP command.

These two commands are not needed for normal operation.

## "NEWSETUP"
It re-initializes the console after making certain configuration changes.

Make sure to issue this command after you set the Latitude or Longitude, and after you
change any of the Setup bits in the EEPROM (address 43 = 0x2B) especially the Rain collector
type,

Example (set a 10 minute archive interval):
## >"NEWSETUP"<LF>
## <<ACK>

"LAMPS <Lamp state: ’0’ (off) or ‘1’ (on)>"
It turns the lamps on the Vantage console on or off.

Example (turn the lamps off):
## >"LAMPS 0"<LF>
## <<LF><CR>"OK"<LF><CR>

## X. Data Formats
- LOOP data format
There are two different LOOP data formats. Rev "A" firmware, dated before April 24, 2002 uses the old
format. Rev "B" firmware, dated on or after April 24, 2002 uses the new format. The only difference
between these formats is the inclusion of the current 3 hour barometer trend in place of the fixed value
"P" in the fourth byte of the data packet.

Only values read directly from sensors are included in the LOOP packet. Desired values (i.e., Dew Point
or Wind Chill) must be calculated on the PC. The LOOP packet also contains information on the current
status of all Vantage Alarm conditions, battery status, weather forecasts, and sunrise and sunset times.

Contents of the LOOP packet.
Field                                Offset                                Size    Explanation
"L" 0 1 Spells out "LOO" for Rev B packets and "LOOP" for Rev A
packets. Identifies a LOOP packet

Wind Direction 16 2 It is a two byte unsigned value from 1 to 360 degrees.  (0° is no
wind data, 90° is East, 180° is South, 270° is West and 360° is
north)
Extra Temperatures 18 7 This field supports seven extra temperature stations.
Each byte is one extra temperature value in whole degrees F with
an offset of 90 degrees.  For example, a value of 0 = -90°F ; a
value of 100 = 10°F ; and a value of 169 = 79°F.

- DMP and DMPAFT data format
There are two different archived data formats. Rev "A" firmware, dated before April 24, 2002 uses the
old format. Rev "B" firmware dated on or after April 24, 2002 uses the new format. The fields up to ET
are identical for both formats. The only differences are in the Soil, Leaf, Extra Temperature, Extra
Humidity, High Solar, High UV, and forecast fields (reedOpen and reedClosed fields are removed).

You can use the VER command and parse the date returned to determine the archive data format, or you
can examine byte 42 in the archive record.   In a Rev B record, it will have the value 0x00. In a Rev A

Page 31 of 59
record, this byte is used for "Leaf Wetness 4" which is never assigned a real data value, so it will always
contain 0xFF. Future record formats may assign different values for this field.

Each archive record is 52 bytes. Records are sent to the PC in 264 byte pages. Each page contains 5
archive records and 4 unused bytes. See section 6 for more details on performing download operations.

The value in the “Dash Value” column is what you will see if that field is not updated at all during the
archive interval.    A dash value can appear for several reasons, and different weather variables are
treated differently.   For example, if you see 32767 for Outside Temperature that could be because of a
communication problem, the sensor was unplugged, or the sensor has failed.   Note, a dashed value is
not always the sign of a problem.  For example, the rainfall reading could be 0 if no rain fell in that
interval.  To determine if a problem exists, often times you will need to look at more than one weather
variable.

- CALED and CALFIX data format
## The "
CALED" and "CALFIX" commands send and receive a block of temperature and humidity data used
to update the current display whenever the calibration offsets are changed. The format of this data block
is:

Field                                    Offset                                    Size   Explanation
## Inside Temperature 0 2
## Outside Temperature 2 2
## Extra Temperature 4 14 (7 * 2)
## Soil Temperatures 18 8 (4 * 2)
## Leaf Temperatures 26 8 (4 * 2)
## Inside Humidity 34 1
## Outside Humidity 35 1
## Extra Humidities 36 7

XI. Download Protocol
There are two commands you can use to get archived data records from the console. "DMP" download all
data records, while "
DMPAFT" only downloads the records archived "after" a selected time and date. The
other advantage of the "DMPAFT" command is that the data blocks are sorted so that the oldest data
downloaded is in the first page sent.  The "DMP" command on the other hand always starts with "page
zero" which may not be the oldest data if the archive memory has filled up.

Page 35 of 59

This section will concentrate on the operation of the "
DMPAFT" command. The "DMP" command is
identical in operation except that you do not send or receive any additional data between sending the
command and receiving archive records.

In order to use the "
DMPAFT" command you need to determine the time and date-stamp of the last record
that you already have, AND this record should match one of the records already archived in the
WeatherLink data logger. (if the data is not found, then the entire contents of the data archive will be
downloaded.)

To calculate the time and date-stamps, use these formulas: (hour is in 24 hour format, both of these
values are 2-byte values)
vantageDateStamp = day + month*32 + (year-2000)*512);
vantageTimeStamp = (100*hour + minute);

Use zero for both of these values (and the CRC) to force a full download.

Send the command "
DMPAFT" to the Vantage Pro
When you get an <ACK> back, send the 2 byte vantageDateStamp, the 2 byte vantageTimeStamp, and a
2 byte CRC value calculated from them. See section XII for more information on calculating CRC
values. Send the MSB of the CRC first, then the LSB.

If the CRC is correct, the console will send back another <ACK> the number of "pages" that will be
send (2 bytes), the location within the first page of the first record, and 2 Byte CRC.
If the CRC is not correct, the vantage will respond with 0x18. If you do not sent 6 bytes, it will respond
with 0x21.

Note that while the console tells you which record in the first page it sends contains the first new data
record, it does not tell you which record in the last page it sends is the last new data record. Records
after the most recent will either contain all 0xFF bytes (if the archive has never been completely filled),
or will contain old data records.

At this point you can either send an <ESC> = 0x1B to cancel the download, or an <ACK> to start the
download.

After receiving each page of data, calculate the CRC value. If the CRC was incorrect, send 0x21 (really
"!" but used as <NAK>) to have the Vantage send the page again.
Otherwise, send <ACK> to receive the next page (if there is one), or <ESC> to cancel the download
early.

Each "Page" is 267 bytes and contains 5 records of data. There are a total of 512 pages of archive
memory for a total of 2560 records. If a "
DMPAFT" command results in downloading the entire archive,
513 pages will be downloaded. The first and last pages in this case are identical.


Page 36 of 59
The format of each page is:
1  Byte sequence number (starts at 0 and wraps from 255 back to 0)
52 Byte Data record
52 Byte Data record
52 Byte Data record
52 Byte Data record
52 Byte Data record
4  Byte unused bytes
2  Byte CRC

See section X.4 for details on the format of the archive data record.

Example (download records after June 6, 2003 9:30am [270 pages, the first valid record is 2]):
## >"DMPAFT"<LF>
## <<ACK>
-- Send the Date and Time stamp --
><0xC6><0xCE><0xA2><0x03>
-- Send the calculated CRC 0xE2B4 –
><0xE2><0xB4>
## <<ACK>
-- Vantage responds with the number of pages it will send --
<<0x0E><0x01><0x02><0x00><2 Bytes of CRC Data>
-- Begin the download – Use <ESC> instead to cancel it
## ><ACK>
-- Block sequence number
## <<0x00>
<<52 byte data record 0>
<<52 byte data record 1>
-- The next record is the first record with new data
<<52 byte data record 2>
<<52 byte data record 3>
<<52 byte data record 4>
<<4 unused bytes>
<<2 byte CRC>
-- At this point verify the CRC and send either <ACK>, <0x21>, or <ESC>


XII. CRC calculation
The console uses the same CRC calculation that was used by earlier Davis Instruments weather stations.

The CRC checking used by the WeatherLink is based on the CRC-CCITT standard. The heart of the
method involves a CRC-accumulator that uses the following formula on each successive data byte. After
all the data bytes have been "accumulated", there will be a two byte CRC checksum that will get
processed in the same manner as the data bytes. If there has been no transmission error, then the final
CRC-accumulator value will be 0 (assuming it was set to zero before accumulating data).


Page 37 of 59
In the following code, "crc" is the crc accumulator (16 bits or 2 bytes), "data" is the data or CRC
checksum byte to be accumulated, and "crc_table" is the table of CRC value found in the array below.
The operator "^" is an exclusive-or (XOR), ">> 8" shifts the data right by one byte (divides by 256), and
"<< 8" shifts the data left by one byte (multiplies by 256).

crc = crc_table [(crc >> 8) ^ data] ^ (crc << 8);

unsigned short crc_table [] = {

When sending a CRC to the console, always send the most significant byte first. This is the opposite of
how regular data values are sent where the least significant byte is sent first.

Example, calculating the CRC in the DMPAFT example above:
Old CRC     Data byte     Table index Table Value  New CRC
0x0000 0xC6 (0x00 ^ 0xC6) = 0xC6 0xB98A (0x0000 ^ 0xB98A) = 0xB98A
0xB98A 0xCE (0xB9 ^ 0xCE) = 0x77 0x0E70 (0x8A00 ^ 0x0E70) = 0x8470
0x8470 0xA2 (0x84 ^ 0xA2) = 0x26 0x44A4 (0x7000 ^ 0x44A4) = 0x34A4
0x34A4 0x03 (0x34 ^ 0x03) = 0x37 0x46B4 (0xA400 ^ 0x46B4) = 0xE2B4


Page 38 of 59
If you continue processing the received CRC value of 0xE2B4 it will look like this:
Old CRC     Data byte     Table index Table Value  New CRC
0xE2B4 0xE2 (0xE2^ 0xE2) = 0x00 0x0000 (0xB400 ^ 0x0000) = 0xB400
0xB400 0xB4 (0xB4^ 0xB4) = 0x00 0x0000 (0x0000^ 0x0000) = 0x0000

The final CRC of zero indicates that the "packet" passed its CRC check.

XIII. EEPROM configuration settings
There are two different ways to access data from the EEPROM. The commands "
EERD" and "EEWR"
provide a text based interface that you can use with a terminal emulation program, such as
HyperTerminal. All numerical data is sent and received as ASCII strings that represent hexadecimal
numbers. You can read as many values as you want with one "
EERD" command, but you can only write
one byte of data for each "EEWR" command.

The commands "EEBRD" and "EEBWR" use similar hex strings to specify what data you want to read or
write, but the actual EEPROM data is send and received as binary bytes. You can read and write as
many bytes as you would like to in a single command.

Both read and written data includes a CRC code. A CRC is required for data written with the "
## EEBWR"
command.

There are several EEPROM data locations that should not be written with the "
EEWR" or "EEBWR"
commands. These are either factory calibration values that should not be changed, or else they are values
that can be set from a different command. For example, use the "
SETPER" command to set the
ARCHIVE_PERIOD value, and the "BAR=" command to set the BAR_CAL and ELEVATION values. It
is safe to read these EEPROM values.

The table below gives the addresses and sizes of the most useful EEPROM data values. The address of
each field is given both in decimal and in hex. Use the hex value in all  "
EE... " commands. There is a
supplemental list of the locations where the Vantage graph data is stored in section XV.

- Setting Temperature and Humidity Calibration Values
The 28 EEPROM bytes starting at address 50 (0x32) contain the calibration offsets for temperature and
humidity values. Unfortunately, if you modify these values in the EEPROM, the new calibration value
will not take effect until the next time the Vantage receives a data packet containing that temperature or
humidity value. In order to update the Vantage display with the new calibration values, you have to
follow this procedure.

Create a data structure to hold all of the calibration values, and one to hold the results of the "
## CALED"
command.

## 1. Use "
EEBRD 32 2B" to read in the current calibration offset values.
- Use "CALED" to read in the current calibrated sensor values.
- Determine what the un-calibrated sensor values are by subtracting the calibration offset from the
data value. Make sure that you only do this if the sensor has valid data (i.e. not 0x7FFF, or 0xFF).
- Determine and write the new calibration values into the EEPROM using "EEBWR 32 2B".
## 5. Use "
CALFIX" to send the un-calibrated sensor values to the Vantage to have the display update
using the new calibration values.

You can use the "EERD 32 2B" command if you want to, but it is harder to process.

You do not have to set all of the calibration values, but you do have to send all of the sensor data values
in the "
CALFIX" command.

- Setting the Time, Time Zone, and Daylight savings
## The "
GETTIME" and "SETTIME" commands will get and set the time and date on the Vantage console, but
you will need to use additional commands to set the time zone and daylight savings settings.

## Daylight Savings

To set up the automatic daylight savings mode (works for US, Europe, and Australia), use the command
## "
EEWR 12 00" (or its "EEBWR" equivilant). To use manual daylight savings mode (or if daylight savings
is not used at all) use the command "
## EEWR 12 01".

If you have selected manual daylight savings mode, use the command "EEWR 13 00" to set standard
time and "EEWR 13 01" to set daylight savings time.

## Time Zone

You can either choose a time zone from the list of timezones shown on the console time zone setup
screen, or you can set the GMT offset directly.

To use a preset time zone, write the zone index number from the table below into the TIME_ZONE
EEPROM field (i.e. "
EEWR 11 xx"), and also write a zero into the GMT_OR_ZONE field (i.e. "EEWR 16
## 00
## ").


Page 43 of 59
To use a custom time zone, write the GMT offset – in (hours * 100 + minutes), to a 15 minute
resolution, with negative values for time zones west of GMT – to the 2 byte GMT_OFFSET field. Also
write a one to the GMT_OR_ZONE field (i.e. "
## EEWR 16 01").

- Setting the Rain Collector type
The rain collector type is stored in the SETUP_BITS EEPROM data byte.

To read what the current rain collector type is:
## 1. Use "
EEBRD 2B 01" to read the current setup bits into the variable setup_bits.
- Calculate: rain_type = setup_bits & 0x30
- rain_type will have one of the following values: 0x00 = 0.01 in, 0x10 = 0.2 mm, or 0x20 = 0.1
mm

To set a new rain collector type:
## 1. Use "
EEBRD 2B 01" to read the current setup bits into the variable setup_bits.
- Mask the rain collector bits to zero with setup_bits = setup_bits & 0xCF
- Set rain_type to one of the rain collector values given above.
- Calculate the new
setup_bits = setup_bits | rain_type
- Use "EEBWR 2B 01" to set the new rain collector type
## 6. Use "
NEWSETUP" to have the Vantage use the new setting.

- Setting up transmitter station ID's and retransmit function.
The 16 bytes of EEPROM data at STATION_LIST, plus the USETX field, control what transmitters the
Vantage will listen to. These can be set for both wireless and cabled consoles, but the cabled ISS will
always transmit on ID 1.
IMPORTANT!! You must use the "
NEWSETUP" command after changing the transmitter ID or
retransmit settings. This allows the console to use the new settings.
## Use "
EEBRD 19 10" to read in the 16 bytes of station data. The format will look like this:
## Index     Contents
Upper nibble Lower nibble
0 Tx period ID 1 Transmiter type
## 1 Humidity Sensor # Temperature Sensor #
2 Tx period ID 2 Transmiter type
## 3 Humidity # Temperature #
4 Tx period ID 3 Transmiter type
## 5 Humidity # Temperature #
6 Tx period ID 4 Transmiter type
## 7 Humidity # Temperature #
8 Tx period ID 5 Transmiter type
## 9 Humidity # Temperature #
10 Tx period ID 6 Transmiter type
## 11 Humidity # Temperature #
12 Tx period ID 7 Transmiter type
## 13 Humidity # Temperature #
14 Tx period ID 8 Transmiter type
## 15 Humidity # Temperature #

Page 45 of 59

The Transmitter type field is taken from either the Rev A or Rev B station type tables below, depending
on the firmware version date (April 24, 2002 and later use Rev B format).

The Tx period field will have one of these values: 0 = station turned off, 1 = ISS normal or Temp/Hum
4x, 4 = ISS 0.25x or Temp/Hum normal.   Note that Vantage Pro2 does not support different transmit
period.  It only supports normal ISS period.

For example, a normal ISS would have the value (0x10 + 0x00) = 0x10. An ISS station being used as an
extra Temp Hum station would have the value (0x10 + 0x03) = 0x13, and a standard Temp Hum station
would have the value (0x40 + 0x03) = 0x43.

The humidity sensor number and temperature sensor number fields are only used if the transmitter type
is a Temperature-Humidity station or a Temperature only station. These fields determine how the extra
temperature and humidity data values are logged. These fields are ignored for other station types.

Starting with ID 1, the first transmitter with an extra Humidity sensor should be assigned the value 1, the
second should have the value 2, etc.
In the same maner, the first extra temperature sensor should be assigned the value ZERO, the second
should have the value 1, etc.

The USETX field holds bitmapped information on the transmitters that the Vantage will actively listen
to. Bit 0 corresponds with ID 1, Bit 1 with ID 2, etc. Set this value after you have made any
modifications to the STATION_LIST field.
IMPORTANT!! You must use the "
NEWSETUP" command after changing the transmitter ID or
retransmit settings. This allows the console to use the new settings.

Retransmit feature
To activate the retransmit feature of the console, write the ID number (1-8) that you would like the
Vantage to transmit on into the RE_TRANSMIT_TX field. This ID can not also be used to receive data
from a remote sensor. Use the value 0 to turn retransmit off.

IMPORTANT!! You must use the "
NEWSETUP" command after changing the transmitter ID or
retransmit settings. This allows the console to use the new settings.

RAIN_STORM_ALARM           91             2           The           rain total alarm is stored in 2 bytes in the resolution of .01
inches.  A value of 0xffff (65535) means no alarm is set.
ET_DAY_ALARM 93 1 The ET day alarm is stored in 1 unsigned byte in the resolution
of .01 inches.  A value of 255 means no alarm is set.

- Calculating ISS reception
The "Number of Wind Samples" field in the archive record can tell you the quality of radio
communication between the ISS (or wireless anemometer) and the console because wind speed data is
send in almost all data packets. In order to use this, you need to know how many packets you could have
gotten if you had 100 % reception. This is a function of both the archive interval and the transmitter ID
that is sending wind speed.  The formula for Vantage Pro2 console is different from the one for Vantage
Pro console.

The formulas for determining the expected maximum number of packets containing wind speed are:
## 25.1*)1(0.50
## 60*
## 0.16
## 1
## 5.2
## 60*
## 
## 
## 
## 
## ID
terval_minarchive_in
## ID
terval_minarchive_in
## (for Vantage Pro)
or

## 16
## 141
## 60*
## ID
terval_minarchive_in
(for Vantage Pro2 and Vantage Vue)


Here archive_interval_min is the archive interval in minutes and ID is the transmitter ID number
between 1 and 8.

It is possible for the number of wind samples to be larger than the "expected" maximum value. This is
because the maximum value is a long term average, rounded to an integer. The WeatherLink program
displays 100% in these cases (i.e. not the 105% that the math would suggest).

XV. EEPROM Graph data locations for Vantage Pro

Please note that some of the pointer values stored in the EEPROM may not be updated immediately,
such as NEXT_10MIN_PTR and NEXT_15MIN_PTR.  This is done to save EEPROM write cycles,
since the EEPROM is good for 100,000 times of write.  Those data will only be saved into the EEPROM
at the beginning of each new month or when the console goes into setup mode.
